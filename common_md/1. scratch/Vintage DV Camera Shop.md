Laying the foundation for my vintage DV/DVI camera shop. Keeping it chill and lowkey, but we're making moves. The main goal is to source, refurbish, and sell vintage digital video cameras, but let's keep the vibe relaxed. ðŸŒ¿=

2024-09-04 02:05 I build a scraper today. Kinda useless to start this without capital to run around buying cameras and the ability to store and refurbish my inventory. This is something I am gonna build slowly. I need to thrift weekly to see if I can find cameras...
