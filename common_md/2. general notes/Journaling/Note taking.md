I guess there is a conversation I should be having with myself regarding note taking, which has become something that I have been conducting for the last year. I believe in a fluid and daily system of note taking that allows for the note taker to find their individual voice. Do not worry about accuracy, although it is important, in your notes. Get all the necessary information down on the page. Do not stop writing.

Without good note taking, there is no retention of information. Accuracy, concision, and deliberacy are all the most important qualities of good notes. The power of inter connectivity from Obsidian is what I want to harness. But fundamentally, I need to take stronger and better notes. My notes from [[Kenyon - BA]] are pretty mid. When I got to Grad school, I want to be ready to create really high quality notes very quickly. 

So we begin.
# Typing Speed
Weirdly enough, this journey into creating the most efficient possible note taking solution for myself ahead of grad school begins with me realizing that I type pretty badly. The fluidity of my thought is prevented from the fact that every time I look up at the screen i am not typing what I am thinking at all or hearing or reasoning about. I hate having to go back and retype. I am going to start by slowing down when I type. But overall I need to re-learn home row. 
[Home row exercises](https://www.typingstudy.com/lesson/1/part/8) <-- These were super fucking annoying. I am going to use [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) instead. I already have a solid foundation, I just need polish.

Because learning home row is proving to be so painful, I am just going to work on refining my current typing skills by exercising them daily. It is important to incorporate hand exercises into any daily programming/desk job. I use a hand squeeze thing.

# Ingestion
As I read or interact with any source of information, I create a note and try to track the information as fluidly as possible while following some rules (more on this later). 

My Obsidian notebook mirrors a Zettelkasten system, with some additions and alterations. My notebook serves as dairy, todo tracker, and information bank. Also it deploys as a web page. I use it like a second brain to organize all the information I want to capture from *any* source material.

Expanding on [[Journaling#Obsidian Notebook Structure]]: 
**"1. scratch"** contains any daily notes that I might take. These note might get deleted or merged into other notes. I try to keep this folder light around five to ten notes.
**"2. resources"** contains any information I have recorded from any medium. Anything that I am learning or thinking about. Slowly information from this folder is referenced and mirrored by the general notes folder.
**"3. general notes"** contains information I am personally knowledgable about and can express in my own terms. It contains any project/application tracking I might be doing. If I need to be the expert on information, I likely have it stored in general notes.
**"4. journal"** contains my daily journal. I try to move anything I write in these to general notes, if relevant. Mostly personal task tracking.
## How to take good notes
To take good notes, I just try to write down anything I think is important. I try to grab key words and critical statements/questions to create headers and structure **later**. It's important to get down raw important material and worry about organization later.
