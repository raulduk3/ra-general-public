Everything that might have to do with my Obsidian notebook and my journals. 

My journal takes a great deal of inspiration from [Odysseas](https://www.youtube.com/@odysseas__). It is honestly a pretty good set-up and I feel like it allows you to just start writing down ideas for something right away while slowly integrating it into the knowledge- and task-base.
## Obsidian Notebook Structure
