## Deliverables
### Marketplace Admin
Manage the approval process of what can and cannot be posted to the marketplace for selling to consumers.
* There isn't a dashboard for this to quickly done, he'd rather be on the course. He needs to be involved in the review process of items being sold on the website.
* No button or function. No process for them to actually buy products. They have to comment on the post or message the seller directory. It becomes messy.
* Does not wanna have to approve purchases or new items on the market.
* Cost efficient as possible. Little to no work.
* Main take-aways: Automated approval of new items that can go under review. 
* Requirements- scough. I just get to chose.
### Seller of Personal Items
Just an average mother wanting to sell average used toys. This should be able to get on the site without even thinking. Not technical at all. Unstructured and general listings. No where for people to easily buy stuff.  As few possible field as possible, but you can add fields. Hands-off as possible. I don't want to update the profile if something goes out of stock. 
- Price, size, color, open-text field
	- dynamic fielding
### Seller of Small Business Items
Owner of small boutique business. Used Facebook market. Sells one off items. Wants to fill out larger orders for people easily. No way for questions to easily as for direct communication. Different sizes and color. Automatically inventory management. Easily add/remove stock.
- wants to see data any useful marketing data to the customers 
- shipping capabilities
- customizable like myspace, for space like logo.
