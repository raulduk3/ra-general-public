[[IPHS 484 Senior Research Seminar]]
## Overview
### Title
**CineMatchAI: A Language Model-Driven Film Recommendation Web Application**
### Abstract
This proposal outlines the development of CineMatchAI, an innovative web application leveraging advanced Large Language Model (LLM) technologies such as LLaMa2 and GPT-4. CineMatchAI aims to revolutionize film recommendation by integrating semantic search through text embeddings and heuristic methodologies, surpassing traditional systems like Netflix in accuracy and user engagement.
## Introduction
### Background
Current film recommendation systems, though effective, largely rely on collaborative filtering and basic content-based approaches, limiting their ability to understand nuanced user preferences. The advent of sophisticated LLMs like GPT-4 offers an unprecedented opportunity to enhance recommendation accuracy through deep semantic understanding and personalized interaction.
### Objectives
- Develop a web application utilizing LLaMa2 or GPT-4 for personalized film recommendations.
- Integrate semantic search and heuristic analysis for nuanced understanding of user preferences.
- **Compare and analyze the effectiveness against existing systems, like Netflix.**
## Methodology
### System Architecture
1. **LLM Integration**: Employ LLaMa2/GPT-4 as the core recommendation engine.
2. **Semantic Search Implementation**: Utilize text embedding techniques to semantically analyze user queries and film metadata.
3. **Heuristic Approach**: Incorporate heuristic algorithms for preference prediction based on user interaction patterns.
### Development Phase
1. **Phase I - Prototype Development**: Create a basic version of the application with LLM integration.
2. **Phase II - Feature Enhancement**: Introduce semantic search and heuristic analysis features.
3. **Phase III - Optimization and Testing**: Fine-tune algorithms and conduct extensive user testing.
### Data Sources and Privacy
- Utilize publicly available film databases and APIs for metadata.
- Ensure user data privacy and compliance with data protection regulations.
## Expected Outcomes
### Deliverables
- A fully functional web application for film recommendations.
- Comparative analysis report with existing systems.
### Impact
- Enhanced accuracy in film recommendations.
- Improved user engagement and satisfaction.
- Potential to set a new standard in recommendation systems.
### Required Resources
- Development team with expertise in LLMs, web development, and data science.
- Access to LLaMa2/GPT-4 and relevant APIs.
- Cloud hosting and computational resources.

## Conclusion
CineMatchAI represents a groundbreaking step in film recommendation, combining the power of Large Language Models with advanced semantic and heuristic methodologies. This project not only aims to challenge existing giants like Netflix but also sets a new direction for AI-driven personalized experiences in the entertainment industry.
## Architecture
### Step 1: User Profile Analysis
- **Process User Input**: Initially, the user provides a list of favorite movies, which are used to fetch metadata from TMDb.
- **Generate User Profile**: The fine-tuned LM analyzes the fetched metadata to identify patterns and preferences, such as favored genres, directors, actors, and thematic elements. This analysis forms a detailed user profile.
### Step 2: Crafting Dynamic API Requests
- **LM-Generated Queries**: Based on the user profile, the fine-tuned LM constructs tailored queries for TMDb. These queries are designed to find movies that match the identified patterns and preferences.
    - The LM takes into account various factors like genre, popularity, similarity to user-favored actors or directors, and other metadata to form the queries.
- **Query Optimization**: The LM can optimize queries over time, learning from past interactions which query parameters and combinations yield the most satisfying recommendations for the user.
### Step 3: Fetching Similar Movies
- **Execute API Requests**: The dynamically generated API requests are executed against TMDb's "Discover" or "Search" endpoints to find movies that match the user's profile.
- **Process Results**: The returned results are processed and filtered, ensuring they align with the user's preferences and adding any necessary metadata for presentation to the user.
### Step 4: Recommendation Delivery
- **Present Recommendations**: The final list of recommendations is presented to the user through the UI, potentially including reasons for each recommendation based on the user profile analysis.
### System Integration Details
- **API Gateway**: Serves as the intermediary for sending and receiving API requests to TMDb, handling authentication and rate limiting.
- **Backend Server**: Hosts the fine-tuned LM, processes input and output, manages session state, and orchestrates the flow between user inputs, LM processing, and TMDb queries.
- **Data Storage**: Stores historical data on user interactions, preferences, and recommendation outcomes to continuously refine and personalize the recommendation engine.
### Implementation Considerations
- **Privacy and Data Security**: Ensure that user data and preferences are handled securely, complying with data protection regulations.
- **Rate Limiting and Caching**: TMDb has rate limits on API requests, so implement caching of frequently requested data and manage request rates efficiently.
- **Model Training and Updating**: Regularly retrain and update the fine-tuned LM with new data to improve its accuracy and relevance in crafting API requests and analyzing user preferences.
