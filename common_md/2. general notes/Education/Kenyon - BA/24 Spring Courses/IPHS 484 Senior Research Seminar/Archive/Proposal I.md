# Research Proposal: Leveraging Large Language Models for Automated Movie Production Document Generation
## Abstract
This proposal outlines a system leveraging advanced Large Language Models (LLaMa2, GPT-4, Bard, etc.) to transform movie scripts into relevant production documents. The system will employ semantic searching through text embeddings and heuristic approaches to analyze scripts and generate necessary documents like shooting schedules, budgets, and storyboards.
## Introduction
The film industry often requires extensive manual labor to convert a script into actionable production documents. This project aims to automate this process, increasing efficiency and accuracy.
## Objectives
1. **Automate Document Generation**: To develop an algorithm that can automatically generate production documents from movie scripts.
2. **Enhance Semantic Understanding**: To improve the model's ability to understand and interpret scripts semantically.
3. **User Interface Development**: To create a user-friendly interface for filmmakers to input scripts and receive production documents.
4. **Accuracy and Efficiency**: To ensure the generated documents are accurate and the process is more efficient than manual methods.
## Methodology
### System Overview
The system will consist of the following components:
1. **Input Module**: Accepts movie scripts in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT).
2. **Processing Engine**: Utilizes Large Language Models (LLaMa2, GPT-4, Bard, etc.) for semantic analysis and document generation.
3. **Output Module**: Provides generated production documents in user-specified formats.
### Process Flow
1. **Script Analysis**: The system will analyze the script using semantic search to understand context, characters, and plot.
2. **Document Generation**:
    - **Shooting Schedule**: Based on scene descriptions and locations.
    - **Budget**: Estimation based on the number of characters, locations, and special effects.
    - **Storyboarding**: Visual representation of scenes using heuristic approaches.
