[[HIST 407 Manhood & Masculinity US History]]
# Argument
"Melissa N. Stein's 'Measuring Manhood' is exploring the ways in which race, science, and gender, specifically masculinity, interplay in America between 1830 and 1934. In the first few chapters she looks a lot at the published material of ethnologists and race scientist at the time in conversation with modern discourse. The modern discourse disproves the scientific process and conclusion drawn at the time, but Stein analyzes how the wide spread acceptance of scientific racism percolated throughout societal institution. Stein provides a history to slavery and the white paternal order that eludes to a sustained impact on our society today.
Stein digs deep into how scientific conversations and methodologies significantly influenced the understanding and construction of manliness, especially against the backdrop of racial differences. Kinda showing how white men demand that they are the only "true" men capable of civilization. Often white ethnologists and theorist were connecting whiteness to godliness. 
Her approach is comprehensive, engaging with a variety of primary sources, from medical and scientific publications to cultural narratives, to map the evolution of masculine ideals through a racial lens. 
Stein's work stands out for its critical examination of how masculinity was never a static concept but always in flux, contested and reshaped by scientific discourse. She sheds light on the powerful role science played in molding perceptions of race and manhood, thereby weaving together the threads of science, culture, and gender in the fabric of American identity. 
This book challenges the singular narratives of manliness often espoused by white scientist, suggesting its multifaceted nature and its diversity.

# Presentation
Today, I will be presenting on how Melissa N. Stein utilizes "Walker's Appeal, in Four Articles: Together with a Preamble, to the Coloured Citizens of the World, but in Particular, and Very Expressly, to Those of the United States of America" by David Walker and "Abolition is national death, or, The attempt to equalize races the destruction of society" by John Van Evrie within her book "Measuring Manhood." These two primary sources are pivotal in understanding the racial and gender ideologies of their times and how these ideologies intersect with scientific thought on masculinity.
Stein interprets Walker's Appeal as a radical critique of racial and gender oppression, showcasing an early 19th-century African American perspective that challenged prevailing notions of race, manhood, and the scientific justifications of white supremacy. Walker's work is a passionate call to action, urging Black men to assert their manhood against the dehumanizing conditions of slavery and racism. In contrast, Van Evrie's work represents the antithesis of Walker's ideals, arguing from a white supremacist standpoint that the abolition of slavery and the social integration of races would lead to the downfall of American society. Van Evrie utilizes pseudo-scientific arguments to legitimize the subjugation of Black individuals and the preservation of white masculine superiority.
I agree with Stein's interpretation of these texts as embodying the contestations surrounding race and masculinity in the 19th century. Her analysis illuminates how scientific racism was mobilized to construct and defend certain notions of manhood while undermining others. Finding these sources in their original forms required searching through historical archives and digital collections, underscoring the importance of primary sources in reconstructing the ideologies of past societies.
Comparatively, Walker's and Van Evrie's works differ significantly in form and intent. Walker's Appeal is a politically charged and morally grounded pamphlet that seeks to empower and mobilize, written from the perspective of an oppressed minority fighting for justice and equality. In contrast, Van Evrie's text is a defensive, reactionary piece, aiming to uphold the status quo of racial hierarchy and white dominance through the guise of scientific reasoning. Both texts are essential for understanding the historical discourse on race and masculinity, offering contrasting viewpoints that reflect the broader societal tensions of their time.
In summary, Stein's use of these sources in "Measuring Manhood" provides a nuanced understanding of the complex interplay between race, science, and masculinity. By examining these contrasting perspectives, she effectively demonstrates how notions of manhood have been historically contested and shaped within the context of racial ideologies and scientific thought.
