Race and the Science of Masculinity, 1830-1934
By doing a gendered analysis the historiography race science, Stein brings out a new meaning to the development of white patriarchal social hierarchies. 
### Introduction
- Stein introduces the concept of "scientific masculinity," showing how science became a key arena for defining and contesting manhood. She highlights how scientific theories were used to justify racial and gender hierarchies, with white masculinity being positioned as the ideal.
- The introduction sets the stage for understanding the book's central argument: that science not only reflected but actively constructed societal norms around race and masculinity. This includes discussions on how measurements of bodies, brains, and other physical attributes were used to make claims about intellectual, moral, and physical superiority or inferiority.
### Chapter 1
- The first chapter delves into the early 19th-century context, focusing on how race and masculinity were intertwined in scientific discourse. It examines how white scientists and thinkers used craniometry (the measurement of skulls) and phrenology (the study of skull shapes to determine character and mental abilities) to argue for the inherent superiority of white men and the supposed inferiority of non-white races and women.
- Stein discusses specific scientists and their works, illustrating how these ideas were propagated and how they influenced broader societal attitudes towards race and gender. The chapter also explores resistance to these ideas and the complexities of scientific debates at the time.
### Chapter 2
- In the second chapter, Stein shifts focus to the late 19th and early 20th centuries, examining the rise of eugenics and its impact on perceptions of masculinity. This period saw an intensification of the belief in the biological bases of racial and gender differences, with eugenics advocating for the improvement of the human race through selective breeding.
- The chapter details how eugenics was used to further entrench the idea that white masculinity was the most desirable and that other races and women were inherently inferior. Stein discusses the role of eugenic policies in enforcing sterilization and immigration restrictions, which were justified through the lens of protecting and improving the "masculine" qualities of the nation.
- Stein also highlights how these scientific discourses were contested and critiqued, both from within the scientific community and by social reformers and activists who challenged the racial and gender biases of scientific masculinity.
