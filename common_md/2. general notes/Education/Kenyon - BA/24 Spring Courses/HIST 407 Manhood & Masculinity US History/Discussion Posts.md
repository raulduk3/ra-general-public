[[HIST 407 Manhood & Masculinity US History]]

In the assigned chapters of "Creating Masculinity in Los Angeles's Little Manila," España-Maram illustrates the complex dynamics between labor, working conditions, and the construction of masculine identities among Filipino migrants during the 1920s-1950s. The backbreaking and often degrading conditions these men faced in agriculture and service jobs not only influenced their self-perception but also shaped broader societal views of Filipino masculinity. Interestingly, despite these harsh realities, Filipino men cultivated a distinct identity through assertive self-presentation and camaraderie. They navigated their marginalization by emphasizing physical strength and resilience as key components of their manhood, challenging the racial and social hierarchies imposed on them. This duality of vulnerability in the labor market and assertiveness in social spheres presents a compelling intersection of race, class, and gender, highlighting the malleability and performative aspects of masculinity in diasporic contexts. Their strategic resistance through style and social interactions reshapes our understanding of manhood under racial and economic oppression.

In "Building Better Men" and "Gendering the Great Depression," both Suzik and Armengol dissect the multifaceted portrayal of masculinity during the Great Depression. Suzik's examination focuses on the CCC's efforts to sculpt the ideal man through physical and moral education, portraying a response to societal needs for a "better" manhood. Similarly, Armengol delves into the Depression's impact on masculinity, highlighting how economic failure led to an emasculation of American men, prompting efforts to reassert traditional masculine virtues through imagery and policy. Both texts reveal that artistic and cultural representations of masculinity serve not only as reflections of contemporary values but also as tools for shaping and challenging those values. How do today's art and media continue this dialogue, often questioning and expanding the boundaries of what constitutes masculine ideals, reflecting ongoing societal shifts towards a more inclusive understanding of gender roles?

In "Manliness and Its Discontents," Martin Summers explores the complex negotiation of black male identity within the middle class during the early twentieth century. This examination offers a nuanced view of how black men sought to define themselves against both the backdrop of American societal expectations of masculinity and the specific challenges posed by their racial identity. Summers highlights the tension between aspiring to a form of manliness recognized and rewarded by broader society and crafting an identity that challenges prevailing stereotypes and discriminations. This tension is symbolic of the broader systemic oppression of black Americans during this period, as they navigated the structures of racism while striving for socio-economic advancement. The middle-class black man's status and respectability involved adhering to certain codes of conduct and presentation, engaging in community uplift, and challenging racial injustices. This dual burden underscores the complexity of black masculinity, where personal aspirations are linked with collective struggles. Summers' work challenges the monolithic perception of masculinity by showcasing its variations and complexities within the black middle class. It prompts us to consider how definitions of manliness intersect with race, class, and time, offering a more comprehensive understanding of the nature of gender identity formation. We can appreciate the resilience and creativity of black men in redefining manliness in a way that honored their experiences and aspirations in the face of injustice. Through "Manliness and Its Discontents," we gain insights into the negotiations made while navigating through manhood within the constraints of racial discrimination and societal devaluation.

In Nicholas L. Syrett's "The Company He Keeps", Syrett delves into the complex dynamics of fraternity life and how its members validate their manhood, especially in the post-war period. This exploration reveals a disturbing facet of fraternity culture: the reinforcement and reproduction of aggressive rape cultures through overt displays of heterosexuality. Syrett poignantly notes, "when a group of people unites around a particular characteristic, they are often derided and dehumanized" (p. 297), highlighting the toxic environment that can emerge within these male-dominated spaces. This statement serves as a critical lens through which we can examine the socialization processes within fraternities that contribute to a culture where masculinity is narrowly defined and aggressively defended. The emphasis on heterosexuality as a cornerstone of fraternity manhood not only marginalizes and excludes those who do not fit this mold but also perpetuates harmful attitudes toward women. By uniting around heterosexuality as a defining characteristic, fraternity members create an echo chamber that amplifies and validates misogynistic attitudes and behaviors, including the objectification of women and the normalization of sexual aggression. Syrett's analysis invites us to question the societal constructs of masculinity that fraternities mirror and magnify. The aggressive defense of a heteronormative conception of manhood within these spaces not only undermines the dignity and humanity of those who are different but also contributes to a culture where sexual aggression is seen as a rite of passage. This reflection on fraternity culture serves as a microcosm for understanding how certain expressions of masculinity perpetuate violence and exclusion, challenging us to envision a more inclusive and respectful definition of manhood.

In Nicholas L. Syrett's "The Company He Keeps," fraternities of the antebellum era are dissected as crucibles for American masculinity, mirroring and molding societal values and biases. These bastions of brotherhood, appearance, and socioeconomic status not only delineated the contours of manhood in the United States but also entrenched them within an exclusivity and hierarchy. Syrett articulates, "They were constantly attempting to control just whom they would call brother" (p. 199), capturing the essence of early social filtration that esteemed certain masculine virtues over others. This elitism was not confined to the moral or behavioral but extended to physicality and wealth, echoing the era's eugenic and racially biased scientific thinking. In exalting particular attributes and classes, fraternities sculpted a vision of national masculinity intertwined with white supremacy and class-based exclusion. Their inherently competitive nature mirrors the professional realm, insinuating that these groups groomed men for a society that prizes competition and dominion among white males. Thus, fraternities emerge as emblematic of patriarchal dominance, perpetuating repressive norms through their exclusivity and obliteration of individual identity. Syrett observes, "Fraternity men was the way that they employed their membership in order to distinguish themselves from others" (p. 78), highlighting how affiliation with these groups became a mechanism for social ascension within a stratified hierarchy. This exclusivity did not merely reinforce ideals of white, male supremacy but also laid the foundation for a societal architecture that sidelines those not fitting into these normative categories, showcasing the influence of early fraternities on American masculinity constructs.

In "Measuring Manhood," Melissa N. Stein critically examines the pathologization of the binary between heterosexuality and homosexuality, highlighted by Michel Foucault's assertion that "the homosexual was now a species." Stein exposes how scientific classification was weaponized as a tool of racial discrimination, particularly against black and brown bodies, marking them as inherently sexually deviant. This conflation of race and sexuality under the guise of scientific objectivity served to reinforce and legitimize stereotypes of deviant sexual behaviors among non-white men, contributing to their marginalization. Stein's analysis reveals the intricate ways in which racial prejudices were embedded within the discourse on sexuality, allowing for the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes with significant real-world consequences. These included justifications for legal and social discrimination, demonstrating the role of science and medicine in maintaining these oppressive binaries. The ramifications of these scientific practices extend beyond their historical context, influencing contemporary societal norms and perceptions of masculinity. Stein's work underscores the importance of critically examining the intersections of race, sexuality, and science in the construction of masculinity, urging a reevaluation of the narratives that have shaped these concepts. Through her analysis, Stein provides a vital critique of how scientific authority has been utilized to sustain power structures, highlighting the need for scrutiny in the fight against biases and inequalities. This reflection is crucial for understanding the roots of gender and sexual discrimination and for fostering a more inclusive understanding of manhood. Stein's contribution is essential for challenging and dismantling the enduring impact of these discriminatory scientific practices.

Melissa N. Stein's "Measuring Manhood" delves into the relationship between 19th-century ethnology, gender, and race, unearthing the role these concepts played in perpetuating white male supremacy in the United States. Stein critiques the pseudo-scientific methodologies of the era, such as phrenology and Craniometry, which were biased to affirm the superiority of white men by pathologizing Blackness and othering non-white races. This framework supported a complex web of racism and sexism, embedded within American society, law, academia, and beyond. The convergence of polygenism and monogenism around the theme of white paternalism, despite their differences, illustrates how ethnology was manipulated to sustain a narrative of white dominance. Stein emphasizes how this narrative was challenged by Black intellectuals like David Walker and Hosea Easton, whose works offered a counter-narrative to the prevailing ethnological thought. Stein's exploration extends beyond mere critique of ethnological practices to connect how these scientific racisms were intertwined with social systems—medicine, law, religion—thereby reinforcing the societal positioning of white men as the creators of knowledge and power. This not only pathologized black and brown bodies but also justified their exploitation. By highlighting how race and gender definitions were co-constructed to uphold white supremacy, especially in the face of a diversifying American society post-Civil War, Stein provides a critical lens through which to examine the legacy of ethnology on contemporary understandings of race and gender. After reading Steins' book, I believe that science has historically been used to justify racism and white dominance because the accepted academic discourse must be conducted by white men in English in a way that perpetuates that order.

The readings from Amy S. Greenberg's "Manifest Manhood" and Gail Bederman's article on Ida B. Wells's antilynching campaign invite a deeper reflection on "restrained" manhood, particularly among Northern White men in the United States during the antebellum period. Bederman discusses how Wells skillfully leveraged the prevailing notions of "restrained" and "civilized" manhood, tying them to the national identity and the ideology of American exceptionalism. Her strategy effectively challenged the Northern White men to see the brutal reality of lynching as a direct affront to their self-perception of civility and moral superiority. This perspective of "restrained" masculinity is not without its flaws. While it served as a moral counterpoint to the violent masculinity of the lynching mobs, it also perpetuated a form of white exceptionalism. This exceptionalism posited that White men, particularly those adhering to these "civilized" standards, were uniquely qualified to maintain and develop social orders. This belief implicitly supported the racial and gender hierarchies of the time. Greenberg's analysis in "Manifest Manhood" further reveals how these ideals of restrained manhood were intricately linked to the expansionist endeavors of the era. The pursuit of domesticating and expanding into the American West, Mexico, and other territories, under the guise of bringing order and civilization, was steeped in a sense of white exceptionalism. This expansionist agenda was another expression of the same hegemonic power structures that enabled racial and gender oppression, masquerading as a civilizing mission. The intersection of Wells’s antilynching campaign with the broader historical context of American expansionism underscores a critical aspect: the ideals of restrained, civilized manhood, underpinned by notions of white exceptionalism, were instrumental in both challenging certain forms of racial violence and simultaneously reinforcing the broader structures of racial and gender domination.
