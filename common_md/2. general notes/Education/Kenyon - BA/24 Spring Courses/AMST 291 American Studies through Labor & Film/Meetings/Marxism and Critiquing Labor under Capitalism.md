| - On your family farm<br>	- you grow your own raw resources and accumulate your own wealth<br>	- you decide what to do with the fruits of your labor<br>- Agrarian societies are more communal | - You work for your boss/manager and the corporation <br>	- the little work you do to making the product <br>- Consumer societies  |
The worker == their labor == they own the products of their creation 
**The more you produce the further you are alienated from the wealth/fruits of your labor**
