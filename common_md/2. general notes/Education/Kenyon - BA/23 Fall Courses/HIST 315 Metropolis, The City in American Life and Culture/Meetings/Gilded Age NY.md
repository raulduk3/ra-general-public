### Discussion Questions
1. How does the film 'Gangs of New York' contribute to our understanding of the Gilded Age, despite being set in an earlier period?
2. To what extent does the film accurately portray the Tammany Hall political machine, and what implications does this have for understanding the power dynamics of the period?
3. Discuss the representation of race and ethnicity in the film. How does it mirror the historical tensions of the time?
4. In what ways does the film challenge or affirm the traditional notions of American identity during the 19th century?
5. Given the course's focus on identity, space, and design, how does the film use these elements to create a narrative about power and community?
6. How does the film address the theme of resilience, especially in the context of individual characters or communities surviving and adapting to their harsh environments?
7. How does the portrayal of social hierarchies and classes in the film reflect broader economic transformations in the industrial age?
