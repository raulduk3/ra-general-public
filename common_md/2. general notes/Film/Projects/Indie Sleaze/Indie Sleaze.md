# Takeaways
- SOUND! SOUND! SOUND!
	- Make sure you have a competent sound person and that they know how to start and stop recording at the right times. Also monitor peaking.
	- When doing multi-track recording with lavs and booms, note which device is being recorded on which track for consistency.
- Plan to light every scene. Make sure you're shooting at the correct ISO. Mainly - *GET CLEAN FOOTAGE* - NO NOISE.
- Continuity should not be sacrificed, it's almost as noticeable as bad acting. 
- Film is just a conduit for good drama-- good acting-- god plot development-- powerful dialogue. Pretty images are the final deliverer of this all.
