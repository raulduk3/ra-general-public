2024-08-21: I added two snails, a blue platy, a java fern, and amazon sword. I think the tank water levels are pretty good. Everyone seems pretty active. I might want to add more fish. I will change up the whole thing in a few weeks once its really fully cycled. 

2024-09-04: Everything is fine. No one is dead! I think I have been adding wayy too much of the solution, need to read the label more carefully. Karina comes this week and when she does I will add another platy, snail, and plant. I hope there isn't an algea spike and I'll do a really nice water change once she is here.

2024-10-18: This tank is doing fine, all water indicators are consistently good. Getting kind of bored of it. I might want to add something to it to spice it up. I want to add a fast growing moss to cover the floor and another fish. Likely to do this in November. Or not, I might be out of here in 10 1/2 months.
