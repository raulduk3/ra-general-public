# Work log
* 2023-07-18: I moved around the back button the page and made sure the footer was sticky and wasn't extending past the max-height of 100%
* 2024-07-14: Lol been almost a year since I last worked on this site. I put it under construction last month. I will finish something up soon. I want it attached to an Obsidian vault like I have [[ra-general-public]].
