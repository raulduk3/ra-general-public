Migrating their medical document system to EPIC (similar to myChart)

https://rushprod.service-now.com/

ServiceNow is the ticketing system we will be using to document any issues on the system and broader IT support for RUSH.

**NO CELLPHONES**

Orientation is Oct 14-17th

Always wearing a badge -> "I am a contractor"

We are providing coverage for all different hospitals in the RUSH network.

Also, one more reminder on the dress code for the project is business casual. No hoodies, sweatpants, t shirts, jeans, etc.

EPIC is a great direction for an analyst career in the health care field. 

6 AM to 2:30 PM 

MS Teams for passing information between sheets. Re-occurring issues need to be escalated. 

Take down all the ticket information and transfer to Beaker. 

INCXXXXX is the format for all ticket IDs.

Check your workstation and phone.

Impact (or Priority): If multiple locations are complaining about the same thing, it raises the impact or priority.

Do not spend more than ten minutes on the phone with any single individual.

One person is dedicated to picking up the voicemails. Do not use a speaker. 

MS Teams on one monitor, and on the other the ticketing system and the EPIC triage guide.

NEVER DO A P1. Also tag all incidents with lab transformation.
