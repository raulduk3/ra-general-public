Mainly you facilitate Lego workshops for kids

Adventures in STEM, STEM Explorations, and STEM FUNdamentals are our basic LEGO® Engineering programs for ages 5-6, 7-12, and 5-10, respectively.

Always round to nearest quarter hour.

# Program Goals (cont.)

Lean into our story/scenario. The scenario is our hook, our “so what?” We want to engage students from the start by creating an imaginative world for them to explore.

Make sure we bring engaging and challenging projects to each class. We want to give them the joy of accomplishing something exciting and new.

Spend time getting to know the students. The more we show interest in the things they are doing and the ideas they have, the more they will feel comfortable in the class and enjoy it.

Best practices to improve learning in the classroom:       
•    Stick to no more than 2 concepts.       
•    Link these concepts when possible. For example, when building a pullback car, we might use the concept of "clock spring" to explain how the other concept of the "pullback motor" works.  
•    Make sure to do call and response to have the students repeat the words they are learning.       
•    Use props and visuals as much as possible.       
•    Keep the concepts age appropriate, things like kinetic energy will probably be too difficult for younger students.       
•    Pick concepts that are appropriate for the project, they should have some tie in with the way the project works or how it is built.       
•    If we don't know what a concept means but want to use it, click on the concept in the Brick Bin to get the information needed to teach it.       
•    Start the week by teaching easier concepts and have them get more challenging as the week goes on.

It is important that we establish clear expectations of what behavior is allowed in our class and find effective ways to hold the students accountable if these expectations are not met.

# Our Rules

These are the rules we teach our students. 

**RESPECT** - what does it mean? Being nice, taking care of something         
      ○    **Respect the instructor**         
             a. Listening/explain attention getter(s) if needed (MUST include this somewhere!)         
             b. Raising hands to talk during Circle Time         
             c. Following our directions 
      ○    **Respect each other**         
             a. **Use kind words**         
             b. Don't take other people's LEGO         
             c. Don't break other people's LEGO   
      ○    **Respect the LEGO**         
             a. Don't put it in your body (nose, mouth, ears, etc.)         
             b. Treat it kindly, don't smash the LEGO       
      ○    **Respect the room**         
             a. Don't touch things that aren't ours to use         
             b. Leave the room cleaner than we found it      

**HAVE FUN!**         

As the instructor, we are here to make sure they can have fun, so let the students know that if they aren't having fun, they should talk to us.

**Important Note:** In general, in our discussion of the rules, we should try to focus on the ‘DO’s’, instead of the ‘DON’Ts', or what 'IS' respectful behavior rather than what 'ISN’T.' Kids love to say what not to do: don’t throw, kick, hit, etc. While some of these are important to mention, try to focus on what behavior we 'DO' want to see.

# Project Presentation

Our Project Presentation Circle Time consists of 4 sections: 

1. **Scenario:** The "why", the hook of the project, it is the story that ties all the other parts together. 
2. **Subject:** The "what", the context about the given thing we are building to get every student to the level of understanding needed to fully enjoy the project and understand why we are building it. 
3. **Concepts and Terms:** The "how", the explanation of physics, engineering, and LEGO building words that link to our project for the day.
4. **Build:** This is where we explain step by step how the students will build the project. Breaking down each sub-assembly and then reassembling each one to complete the full build. Students should not be building at this time, just listening.

# Always Bin

When looking at a project, the pieces from the always bin will be marked with **

- 4x and 6x plates                      
- 8x16 plates                      
- Angle Beams
- 2-10 Beams
- Axles and Pins
- Pulleys and Bushings
- 12-14 Stud Holey Beams                      
- 16 Stud Holey Beams                      
- Rounds and Holed Plates                      
- Gears                      
- Battery Pack Mounts                      
- Turntables

# Class Introduction

1. Warm up
2. Class Introduction - Who are you? Fun fact? 
3. Movement Exercise
4. Circle Presentation
5. Build time
6. Clean Up

# Consequences

If students are disrespecting our class and breaking rules, we need a system of consequences to respond with. These consequences usually consist of:

First, **A reminder**, to gently let the student know they are not following one of our rules and suggest how they can fix that

Second, **A warning**, to let them know that if they continue, they may have to sit out

Third, **Sitting out**, to let that student cool off before coming back hopefully ready to be a better participant in class

Fourth, **Getting in touch with guardians**, if things progress further, or there are more glaring and immediate issues like hurting another classmate
