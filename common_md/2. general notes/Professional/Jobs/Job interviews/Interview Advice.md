## Opening questions
1. Is this position part time or full time?

## STAR method

## RA Specific
Strengths
- Technical skills: editing software and prog
- Developed my writing skills across disciplines. A large amount of my coursework here at Kenyon in the History and English department has revolved around writing and interrogating the details from films and I am tuned into what to look out for in scripts. 
Weakness
- Stubborn about pushing out the best work possible and I can get tunnel vision without consulting my teammates enough. I have tried to improve this by learning to appreciate the importance of teamwork and putting on emphasis on collaboration. Knowing when to delegate tasks for maximum efficiency and learning to turn to other interns for their thoughts. 

Under pressure --> I would communicate with the team. Take a step back. I will begin to weigh urgency and importance of each task at hand.
