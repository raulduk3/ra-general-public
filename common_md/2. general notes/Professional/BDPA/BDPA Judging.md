# Judging Initial Meeting on 2024-07-17
Reviewr to judge student submissions
- login info
- how to run their environment
- how to access to their solution
- any added constraint
We will each judge one to two teams.

Each submission has an AWS workspace. You will use Amazon WorkSpaces to access each submission. **Use judge access password to login to their workspace.**

[Judging material](https://github.com/nhscc/learner-resources/tree/main/judging)

There are two parts of every submission PS1 and PS2. PS1 is the long form problem statement, and PS2 is a the short form eight hour competition completed at the conference. 

Finish judging by the 29th of July.

If a solution is not pretty but otherwise meets a requirement, that counts as reasonably satisfying that
