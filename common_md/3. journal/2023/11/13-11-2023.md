It would be dope to potentially shoot on homage to Kenyon College on the BMPCC 6k for the bicentennial. Maybe I could work with that one drone guy too. [[Bicentennial Special Project]]
I also need to go talk to that one Dean about getting my IPHS course for next semester. I doubt it will be a very sexy class. Maybe I should just opt to try to find some hot girls to spend my last semester in undergrad around. I think that's pretty valid.
