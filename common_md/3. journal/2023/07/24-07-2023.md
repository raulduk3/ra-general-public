I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, and wear Reebok.

Gonna have a super productive day! ðŸ˜€
I ended up doing most of the stuff I needed to do today. Kenyon needs more papers for me to get my money, fucking assholes.
I filled out the form with Pa, and we submitted it online. I'll call back at the end of the week.
I just finished watched [[The Graduate]] again and I have some thoughts. I also read this one article. Fuck you, Benjamin.
I helped Mama all day because Brandon was in a bad mood. He's stressed about Life. It's something I can deeply relate to, but I think Brandon just needs some therapy. Simple counseling will help him.
We worked out later in the day. He said I'd be too sore to work out tomorrow, but I think I'll be fine. I wanna workout again. 
I got that pump in me.
I also watched and took notes on [[The Robert Rodriguez 10 Minute Film School]] late.
