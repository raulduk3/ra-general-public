The greatest achievement of humanity is not its works of art, science, or technology, but the recognition of its own dysfunction.
— Eckhart Tolle
Journaling has become a great tool for me. I can express my emotions and thoughts somewhere. I want to grow to love this place. I don't want to become overwhelmed with the lists of tasks below. I guess I am learning to hear my own voice, and it's becoming clearer and stronger. I still edit myself a lot, but I think it's because my ideas come out jumbled. I think by writing more, I will be able to communicate the more complex ideas in my head more clearly.
Also, I think my emotional bullshit writing will pour out onto here and all the will be left is calm cool collected Ricky built to appease the people.
Writing and reading are the most amazing high vibration activities.
I wrote Isabel's letters today. She is such a wonderful person- I'm trying to enjoy the moments, while they last.
yeaaah, pretty uneventful. I really need to start on this whole quitting smoking thing, because everyone in my life knows to ask me now and its getting pretty embarrassing when I always say 'yes, I am still smoking'
