Edison failed 10,000 times before he made the electric light. Do not be discouraged if you fail a few times.
â€” Napoleon Hill
I didn't do shit today, I sunbathed and submitted my financial aid stuff for Kenyon.
I am about to graduate, it is really hard to believe- sometimes I think I haven't learned a thing.
I hope that by encouraging myself to write more frequently in this log format, I will become a stronger person who understands themselves more.
I realize most of us walk around in a foggy haze of emotional reactions and thoughtlessness. I want to be present, but full of engaging critical thought.
I see living a lot like reading, and some of us are capable of reading the present moment at really intricate and detailed levels. People are capable of taking the present moment, and placing it in rigorous conversation with the theories and assumptions that our shared reality is based upon.
