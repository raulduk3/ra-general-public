Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is God's gift, that's why we call it the present.
— Joan Rivers
Hey, its 0:02 :0
I think I want to build out [[6 - projects/Web/johnortiz 1.com/johnortiz.com]] as much as I possibly can today. I'll start by taking the existing design on his website, and scraping as much of the data I can. 
I will get it up and running quick with Vercel.

I have awoken. I will not be doing that today. I will probably just edit the script for [[Indie Sleaze]], and nap. I am getting dinner with my friend Alexis later. I love her a lot, and I want to exist calmly in the present moment. I will make sure to take a long nap around 13:00, but I will text her first.
So for the period of time from now until 13:00, I'll respond to Isabel's letter. And watch a film. I am pretty happy with my Obsidian set-up, and how tasks flow through it naturally. 
Connecting it deeper into the Google world seems attractive, but I feel like I wanna be able to just use a Calendar and Obsidian for all my personal knowledge.
