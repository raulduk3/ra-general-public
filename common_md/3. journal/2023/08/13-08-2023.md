I'm gonna start working my resume today. I am excited to be going out to Michigan. A part of me desperately yearns for escaping. Getting out of dodge. 
I think I'll use Latex for the resume. It would make sense to have a CV for film and one for CS. 
I think I will wait to create my film CV down-the-line once I finish [[Indie Sleaze]] and anything else I might be involved in this year :).
