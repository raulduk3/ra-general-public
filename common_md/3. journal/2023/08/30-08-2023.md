title: 30th Wednesday August
---
I gotta organize this Obsidian vault today-- I wanna add all my classes as recurring tasks that should be crossed off.
Okay, lets get ordered-- syncing my tasks and events across Google Calendar and Obsidian is proving to be kinda difficult. I will probably use them both at the same time.
Major deadlines like class assignments I will put into my Vault, but class meetings and other events like that will stay in Google Calendar. Stuff inside Obsidian should stay in the "digital"/"work" realm, and Google calendar should tell me where I need to be on certain days.
```tasks
(due on 2023-08-30) OR ((heading regex does not match /Daily/) AND (not done))
not done
sort by due
limit 10
```
