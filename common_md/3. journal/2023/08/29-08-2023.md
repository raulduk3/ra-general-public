Fun day.
Got some work do on [[Indie Sleaze]] and that feels great. I still have a lot more to do. Kinda like cycling. 
I have been getting into biking much more seriously. I have a job interview set-up on Thursday which is dope. I think that will be super exciting to see if I can start getting a steady income here in Ohio. I would use to start growing mushrooms and building up my bike to something that I can actually ride well. I wanna keep as much as the vintage ride in tact as possible. I love the old friction shifters and weird brakes. I think I will need new parts below-- which is something I need to learn to do well. Kinda like writing. I think I will be writing a lot more this semester. I need to diversify my sentence structure lol. Maybe my thought patterns are just getting the same.
