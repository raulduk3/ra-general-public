title: 25th Friday August

Time to get fucking lit, so excited for the first weekend back :)
I am going to [[FILM 480 Senior Seminar]] today. As I got to classes I think I will organize my email and vault.
I wanna start thinking how can I build scripts to sync and integrate my tasks in the cloud. I want to be able to get emails for tasks and keep all my machines updated easily with sync.
