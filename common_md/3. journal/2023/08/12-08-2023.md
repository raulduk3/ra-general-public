title: 12th Saturday August

The days are dragging along- I look forward to seeing Isabel soon. I need to get excited about working on something again, like this site for Sun. I need more material. Or some inspiration. 
I'm gonna try to go for a bike ride today and hoop. I need to get my cycling game up to top notch during this next year. Also, I intend on becoming a coherent and powerful writer in the this next year. I plan on achieving this by practicing good style and grammar in this daily journal. 
Today, I worked on getting my Vim dot files across my GitHub account which I think is good, but I also started a project folder for Sun's website. ChatGPT to get the ball rolling? I think yes, I think yes very fucking hard.
I will get back into the flow of reading and writing about the LLM technology soon. Even though Chun and Elkins are gone for the next semester, I will seek out Devon and maybe some other people who might be interested in this AI-script generated nonsense/bullshit.
Also, I wanna make sure I got bread while I am at Kenyon. In order to be certain that I can achieve a sufficient amount of income flow, I will try to get a job at the library doing something in IT. I need to start developing a resume that's gonna get me that kush tech job in the next 3-4 years.
