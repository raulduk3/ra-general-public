Yikes, took a couple days off from journaling/work. 
I need to get back on top of my shit. 
Because my goal is to finish it before the end of the week, I'm gonna start work on [[6 - projects/Web/tinytrashthief 1.com/tinytrashthief.com]] today.
```tasks
(due on 2023-08-06) OR ((heading regex does not match /Daily/) AND (not done))
not done
sort by due
limit 10
```
