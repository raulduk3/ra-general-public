title: 14th Monday August
---
Got home from Michigan. So ready to get out of this shit hole ass city (even though Chicago is a perfect and beautiful place) I simply don't exist in this context correctly yet. I worry about what it will be like to go back home, I almost want to stop time. Prevent it from going forward so Kenyon doesn't have to end, so my relationship to Isabel stays this simple, and my life is just this simple. I know there are greater more beautiful things to come, but **I need to work hard**. If I am going to achieve the things that I want.
```tasks
