Not much to report on; that's juts how it goes.
I'm actually afraid Isabel is gonna eventually reveal here naturally determined hate me... because I'm a quirky coder nerd Mexican from Chicago. I feel like a loser. She's not perfect, but I wish we were the kind of people who could fall into that deep sort of love that feels like it should be permanent. She's holding back, and I miss her.
I need one day to write, I am gonna try to make it tomorrow. 
Goodnight for now.
