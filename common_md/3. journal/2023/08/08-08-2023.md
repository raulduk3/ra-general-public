Today I linked up with Jorge and Joaquin at a coffee shop. I am a fan of it. I got a new bike lock today too from Irv's. It was really nice to see those guys, they've always been super helpful about getting my bike stuff together since I was little.
Quitting cigarettes has been so hard, and I got ahold of my friend vape the other day and it kinda broke my streak. I haven't smoked. I want to sit down at the end of the year after all this bullshit work has been finished and I am just free to explore myself and the world as an artist, I wanna sit down and smoke a cigarette then. I fee like it will feel like getting in an airplane. I might just be saying that because Joaqu√≠n is next to me.
I saw Noah and Gio yesterday. It was really nice. And I'm gonna see them again Thursday, I think I might actually record something with them this summer and That makes me so excited.
I email prof for Socialism at the Movies, hopefully I get into the class.
