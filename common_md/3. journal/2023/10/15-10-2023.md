Today was a good day, I drove from the airport. It was a blur saying goodbye to my parents. Next time I have to say goodbye to them, I will make sure to do it right.
It was very good to be back home. I enjoyed every second I got to spend in the City. I feel the magic still, and I know many people do not feel that same magic in Chicago, but maybe one day I will get bored of the Lake and the CTA. It's been everything I have ever known, and a huge part of me know that I am supposed to explore and go out and see the world, even if it's not the most comfortable thing...
Camping.
