I want to get back to writing in this more often. I know its a healthy exercise that keeps my mind working.
I need to start writing my essay, but I think I will opt to create a dust.tt plugin to write my papers for the rest of the semester. I need to focus on getting into grad school. It's really for the better if I chose to pursue higher education than more money. 
I want to finish a good film to present at the end of the year, so I can be done with this shit. I am tired of having to make movies the way the fuckers in the classroom tell me how I have to. I want get into more experimental work, right away. I think I'm pissing them off and that feels like a good thing to do be doing. 
I should really try to just write every single thought that I have in the daily note and then organize it later.
Hotkeys.
