15:42 First day back to writing in my journal in a while... I have had some ideas come to me. Like storing this entire Obsidian in the cloud and working on that copy from all my machine instead of having to sync it using git. That should really only be for when I want to push the changes up to the website. 

A part of me wants to try to sell these window machines at a physical location when I get back from New Jersey. There is really no need to have them anymore, and they are ugly, slow, and boring pieces of equipment. 

I have been struggling to get to the keyboard at a consistent time everyday. Karina is demanding and my family structure is broken. I have been going out a lot which is really good for me. It makes me feel young and alive, and when I am dying I know those will be the moments I want to live in forever. My dreams.
