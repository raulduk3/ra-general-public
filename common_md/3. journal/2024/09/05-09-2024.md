I absolutely must finish my notes and the modules today. I will finish writing the notes and then do the practice test. If I need to, I will finish up the remaining modules. 

I GOT A LOT OF THE SHITS DONE. I finished up more modules, yay :) I am ready to take the [[CompTIA ITF]] test! It took me 19 days, which is good I guess. I wanna start the [[CompTIA A]] and study for maybe double that time, so roughly 38 days and take the exam in mid-October. Will plan for that more next week. 

16:56 Karina is gonna be done with her first real LSAT soon, I hope she does well so she's in a good mood. I think she will be and we will have a great time when she comes to visit. 

17:14 Fifteen more minutes to go, I will text her at 5:30. I set an alarm. I want to go for a ride and miss some of the introduction stuff for [[NYU Tandon Bridge]], but that might be a really bad idea. Everything is recorded though, so I can circle back and check up on what I miss. 

17:22 She's okay god bless.
