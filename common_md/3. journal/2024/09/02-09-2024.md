12:18 Disaster averted lol, I was sure this computer was down for the count last night. I think I enabled secure boot on a board that isn't UEFI, so the machine was unable boot correctly and connect to the graphics card? Perhaps, I am not sure, but its chill because the machine is working again. I feel good about that, I was really sure it was down for the count. I am start much later than I usually do though, I woke up today around 11. Just gonna try to smash as many as [[CompTIA ITF]] modules as I can today while getting my WSL setup back up and running. I have uninstall Valorant lol.

Still thinking about how I am gonna work across all my machines and where I am going to store all this film equipment. Honestly, I could move around some of the stuff in the "cold storage" unit. I have so many books and notebooks I should probably but them all together. Mainly notebooks. Even underneath my bed is getting overwhelmed with books I haven't read yet. 

12:55 Fixed the whole windows machine, back to working shape again with WSL setup. I love that. I am getting pretty fast at setting that up.
