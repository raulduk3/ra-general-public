12:30 Good morning. I really have been getting consistently late start lately. I need to get a lot better about that. I am aiming to be up and running and doing work by *8 AM* sharp everyday. I want to get the most out of my time when I am alive. I just need to do one day where I am really tired. I wish I had something I had to wake up for, like a job. I guess its good I don't have a job yet.

I need to sell all the stuff downstairs with Dad today. I don't really wanna trudge through taking notes for the ITF+, since I believe I will gain a more rigourous understanding of all these topics through pursuing other certificates and through my graduate coursework. The completionism in me is telling me to do it anyway. I have the time today and it really is the only thing that I can do to get closer to getting that job in NYC in a year. That really is the goal. I think you will be able to save enough money to jump over there. Like a band or two. Just need to get creative. Maybe sell some mushrooms.
