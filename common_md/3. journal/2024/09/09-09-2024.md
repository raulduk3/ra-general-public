11:17 I had a great day with Karina and I want to hold onto her forever. I think it'll be better if she leaves on Wednesday just so she can keep studying her best. I don't want to wait till the end of October to see her. I am gonna work with Martin on getting my [[CompTIA A]] certificate, which is apart of my larger goal to get ITF+, A+, Network+, and Security+ before the end of 2024. I think this will set me up as a really strong candidate for [[NYU Tandon]] and for finding a job in NYC in 2025 to potentially live with Julian. Today **must** be super productive [[NYU Tandon Bridge]] work day. I at least need to finish all the readings and look at the homework.
