Weird day today. Some changes to the structure of the journal, but overall there are no issues with the flow. I know there are many journal entries that are empty, but I like keeping them now with the addition of my calendar. I want to continue keeping a routine flow of opening up Obsidian and jotting down notes. Tracking all my tasks in one place is an extraordinary tool for productivity. One day I want to make a video demonstraing how awesome this set-up is. I want to live in it for another 12 months before I do something like that. I want to stress test it with the [[CompTIA Certificates]]
