11:49 I had a hard time getting into the flow of things this morning. It's okay, I will still make sure to get things done today. I have to be more routined. 

I also realized that it might be more efficient for me to NOT complete the exercise on zyBooks and just read them. I will likely need to review proofs before the first exam.

When I am writing in my journal daily, my mind is more focused and less constricted. A daily writing practice is what allows us to hear our own voices and learn from ourselves. If we don't understand our own inner communications, how will we ever understand what we say to others? I try to treat myself like my best friend. My closest ally. My lover. My father. My mother. It's a good place to be.
