[[Daily Sequence]]

12:05 I went to a coffee shop this morning. I ordered a Chai. I need to study for the [[CompTIA ITF]] cert today. I want to be completely caught up, so that I can start editing my short film. I miss working on films, and lately I have been very distracted from my creative endeavors. I hope that setting up a new windows machine with the dedicated graphics card will allow me to start doing my serious visual effects. I wonder if I can add the old GPU that I have to the current machine to make it more powerful... I really wanna start doing some 3D renders and weird animations to composite onto my DV footage. 

15:11 Back home now working at my desktop, starting to get comfortable on windows again. I miss Karina really bad and I would like to go get lunch with her right now.
