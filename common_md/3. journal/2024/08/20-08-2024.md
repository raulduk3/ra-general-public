[[Daily Sequence]]

08:32 Finished up my modules for today. I start Tandon Bridge tomorrow. Sitting here with the family at the Lake. It's a pretty slow morning and Karina kinda hit me with some bogus news that shes staying four days during the week. Kinda mid, not really sure I wanna keep dealing with this. I have to ask myself if I am happy, but I just want to do right. I know doing right by her would be doing what makes me happy. I am still thinking about it.
