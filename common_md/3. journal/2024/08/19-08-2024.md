[[Daily Sequence]]

**07:26** Spending the day with Dad at the lake house. I like it out here. Time moves slower. I think I will try to come out here on the weekends with my Dad this year. Until he comes back home. I think he should come back home and fix his basement. Today, I am going to work on the cert and maybe look at [[machinetelevision.com]]. I need to finish up a project in C++ soon. I need to implement something by hand manually, without using AI assistance. 

**07:58** Breakfast now. Just gonna drill the cert today. I might work on Jorgie's site later. It needs some tuning up. 

**09:22** back from breakfast it was nice. I wanted to fish, but I casted out a line and lost the fishing hook. Kinda an upset. I had to kill a worm for that. I am back in the trailer working on the cert. I am reading and taking notes on the study guide, despite being able to inference over 80% of the questions on the practice platform without any difficulty. I like when I am able to get into a flow with my writing and I don't have to look up back at what I wrote. I think that is when I really write my best sentences, when they just come naturally.
