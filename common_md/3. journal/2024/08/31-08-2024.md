[[Daily Sequence]]

01:47 early morning trapping. I am super excited to get to work on Tandon bridge. I wanna try to edit Indiesleaze soon tho. I want to buy a tripod. Once the money from the BDPA comes in, I will buy a nice tripod for at least a couple hundred of dollars. 

07:59 Good morning. I didn't sleep so good, too much dairy. I am going to re-install Windows 11 on this machine and put it on the other disk drive. I need to check which one is an HDD and a SSD. I think my dad put the OS on the larger drive so there's just a bunch of awkward partitions and lame naming conventions. Also, all his left over tools which I do not need. This wasn't a very good reset... It was super easy to get my set-up configured mostly on Windows 10. Valorant would be a fun game to have on my PC that isn't super intensive to run.

11:48 Gonna go grocery shopping with Dad soon. It seems that both disks are SSDs, so that's good. I wanna put in another dent into this [[CompTIA ITF]] stuff, because I need to start preparing for [[NYU Tandon Bridge]] and the much more valuable and hard [[CompTIA A]] cert.
