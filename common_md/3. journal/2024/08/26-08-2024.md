[[Daily Sequence]]

09:36 Woke up and smoked while Karina went for a walk, it was a really nice morning. She has become apart of my daily routine and I appreciate it greatly. To get started with my work today, I will tend to my [[Journaling]] and flush out all the details and tasks for [[NYU Tandon Bridge]]. I want to get an MS in Computer Science and focus on Machine Learning OR get an MS in Computer Engineering and focus on Machine Learning, lol. Either way I want to prepare myself for high-paying positions. More strategizing to be done.

11:45 Pretty much done with all the [[NYU Tandon Bridge]] stuff I want to do this morning. It was pretty easy to get oriented and fill out all the necessary information.
