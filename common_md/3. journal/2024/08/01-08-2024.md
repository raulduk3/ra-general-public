Atlanta is full of music, but it's not much different from home. All the cities smell like shit and sewage. Today my mother and father separated. Lately, I wonder about how much of my life has been cycles of rejecting and accepting myself. I wonder if I always overdo hating and loving myself. I want to find a balance.
