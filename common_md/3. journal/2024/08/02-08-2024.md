Made it down to the judging session. Late. I have the career fair today, which I hope goes well. I want to make some good impressions and hopefully people will like my attitude and appreciate my skillset. I am feeling better about the whole situation with my father. I will feel a lot better once I have a job and I never need to ask him for anything ever again. He lied to my mother's face.

 Need to to get work. I will finish the PS2 submissions by the end of the day. They're due at 7PM EST. I am going to a career fair today, it's probably best I don't think about my situation at home. I did my key warmups and now I am thinking about what to do with the rest of the time I have. Judging should take about two-gish hours, so I will set aside some time
