17:26 Weird days. Made a serious dent in the self study program for the [[CompTIA ITF]] cert. I feel like I am going to pass this without trying too hard, but let me see what happens when I get through all the modules. 

18:10 Gonna change up the strategy a little bit and read the whole study guide and take notes while I do it. I am going to prepare for the [[CompTIA A]] cert similarly with just a book reference and maybe a practice test. I think after I finish taking notes and reading the book for the first time I can go back in and be more thorough about what I need to memorize and internalize. I think I can relate all the information I have learned together. I can't wait till I get a real sense of the hardware engineering side the motherboards and integrated chips.
