I really miss working on video projects; it would mean a lot to me to start being myself again- I think I have gotten to caught up with all the shit and sex and I should try to keep myself above it.
I miss Isabel and I miss her dearly. I want to have one more conversation with her before I leave, it would mean the world again to see her smile and laugh. Just being around her was really calming to me, she saw me for who I was and still loved me. She said I had a good heart.
