title: 19th Fri

I can't explain the feeling that washed over me. Ten pounds of heroine, ten spoonfuls of morphine, a sheet of acid, or endless liquor could not cease the uneasy urge I felt at the deserted age of twenty-two. My girlfriend is sitting next to me in the campus library basement. She has been fucked by every hunk I know and she's eyeing down more. Maybe she isn't. I've known her for four years. She acts and talks like a baby around me and we've been dating for less than a week. We're exclusive now. These days, I get the sense she might love me. Even though I am ready to masturbate into anything that can verify they're eighteen, consent, and tell me I'm the nicest lay they've ever had. 
And maybe I'd call it pity. I am always so busy pitying myself for the mistakes and fumbled bags. It's really this feeling that leads me to do some of the most self destructive things. Maybe I am dating Karina out of self-pity. I can't really place the way I feel about all the people she's fucked; its hypocritical. She just makes it so competitive.
