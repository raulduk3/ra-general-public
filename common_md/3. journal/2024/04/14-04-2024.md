title: 14th Sun

You're sitting at the desk. Doing your work. The buildings and trees of our small liberal arts college are fading in the bluest sunset. The light looks so beautiful on your hair and you're singing. I know, undoubtedly, I will love you this way forever. I want to die locked away in our study having sex and smoking. I don't want to say goodbye to you. I want to take you to a beach. Somewhere WARM where I can run my fingers across your body and touch the sand and water. I hope you miss me as much as I will miss you. I want my eyes to widen to the size of the moon to see all of you. I want to be the best fuck you've ever had and I want you to scream my name one more time and mean it. That you feel great around me. Like I do when I am standing quietly next to you. I love you Karina. I will love you this way forever.
