Dear Tre,
I hope this email finds you comfortably at your desk with Kiari nearby. Despite the fact that we couldn't hang out in person since you left Chicago and I went off to college, you have been someone I could count on consistently for an open ear and clear concious over the phone or during spring break visits. First and foremost, thank you. I will never forget how you always open your home to me and my brother, like family. These are the qualities of amazing an teacher, which you are undoubtably one.
- discuss the GRE, my 3.0 gpa in Film, my research experience, and goals to attend an CSMS program.
	- I want to get a near perfect GRE score to offset my GPA and unrelated major 
	- I struggled at Kenyon which is a hard school and ended with a 3.0, I feel like my reading comphresnion and written/communication skills have improved dramtically (despite the onset of LLM technology which i rely on heavily for writing)
	- I contributed research at a somewhat inconsequential degree to LLM technology and I was published twice. I recieved As in those classes. I believe the professors would graciously reach out.
- I plan on studying for the GRE, trying to get a certificate in a relevant technology, and developing one - two complete demonstration projects in my specilization (Image and Video Recognition, Game AI, XAI (Explainable AI), Predictive Analytics, Autmated Video Editing)
- ask for guidance and suggestions. Politely resquest if Tre would be intersted in helping write a LOR for my application to grad school.
