2024-07-29
16:02: I am on my home from Tampa. I have not been on my laptop or working for many days, but I am excited to get back to work and start the [[NYU Tandon Bridge]] program on August 15th. I need to collect as much material as I can on C++ and CI/CD workflow as possible before I begin. In order to be in the best shape possible to complete the program and get into the masters track, I need to perform at my absolute best. **I must get into the Master's program at NYU**. I look forward to the challenge and coding on extensive projects.
I am about to be in Atlanta. I look forward to spending time with Tre. He always improve my ability by a magnitude every time I sit down with him. 
I am going to work on my portfolio during the flight. And also plan out what stuff I should do for Jorge's site this week. Most importantly, I need to stay on top of finding a job.
