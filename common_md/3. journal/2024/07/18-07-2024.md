15:17: It is a good day. I finished applying to the [[NYU Tandon Bridge]] program, tuned up my resume/linkedin, and I am about to go a run with Carmen.
21:01: I made a slight mistake when I submitted my application. I tried to resubmit the document, hopefully because I am early they will allow for the change. Nervous about the application and I am gonna try to apply to more. Need to do more writing, but I have a lot pulling me away from my desk. I love Karina.
