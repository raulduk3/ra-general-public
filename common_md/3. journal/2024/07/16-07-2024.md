10:53: Good morning world. I need to really lock into studying for the GRE. I am going to find an online course today.

Didn't do too much today. Yikes. Did meet with Karl, gonna email him my resume. Started [[Running|running]] with Carm today. Definitely something I want to continue to do.

I have to pick a day to edit Indiesleaze. I wanna take a video montage of me editing it.

- [x] email Karl your resume #pro ðŸ“… 2024-07-18 âœ… 2024-07-17
