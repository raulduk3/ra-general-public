12:48: Have not been working too much, but I have to apply to a couple more [[Post-Baccalaureate]] programs to ensure that I am doing the right things the next few months. They key is to stay consistent and not get overwhelmed. Do not push yourself too hard. 
14:25: Mark and I were about to go play golf, but then he told me he got rejected from UIC. So I am making him clean his room. He is trash and bathes in trash! I want to turn my brother into gold. I haven't even achieved it myself yet, but I know that it is a balance. A true transcendence. I am talking out my ass rn, but I want to help get his life in order and all his ducks lined up. Whatever you wanna call it. I feel like I have a lot to do myself.
