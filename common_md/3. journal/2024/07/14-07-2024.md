13:00: Getting a late start today. I spent most of the day re configuring my [[Note taking]] system in Obsidian. I think this way will allow for a more streamlined note taking on different material as well as my personal journal and to-do tasks. I use the # system in obsidian to reference different general topics. But I also create index pages that references that tags too. I think this will create a doubly effective way of connecting different ideas. I will link different material to pages in my general notes as they become relevant. It as simple as being interested in anything, creating a note, tagging it, and then organizing.
17:40: Otp with Karina and Sam. Pretty mellow day. Might check on [[greasyvocab.com]] and make some style changes to the home page. Right now I am gonna quickly make some changes to the [[ra-general-public]]. I think everything should work pretty well now :).
19:06: Finished all the changes to my notebook gonna make dinner and maybe work for a few hours more... Mark and I are making pizza. 
20:49: I really like the system I have concocted over the last year for taking notes. Now it is time to stress test it by bringing in useful information! I still believe paper and pen is a very valid system of note taking, but now I have decided to move over to exclusively using Obsidian. I will test this out while studying for the GRE. I expect hurdles I will run into will being able to easily draw on the notepad... I think using a physical note pad for taking notes on my GRE book will be best, sadly. Tomorrow, **must be a *big* GRE day**.
