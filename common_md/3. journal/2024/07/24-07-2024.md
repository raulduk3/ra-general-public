12:24: Back in the saddle. I have been working out a lot lately, but haven't been at the desk very much. I have made a lot of progress this summer. I know am becoming very orientated on being as productive as possible in my time on this planet. Each season goes by and I want to know more and do more and be able of more. Also becoming a better person. Someone who is loved.
We're getting a lot done today with my resume and starting to plan out the new and improved [[raulduke.com]]. This is going to be the best one I have made yet, and it will serve as demonstration of my *advanced* web development skills. Speed, efficiency, beauty, and minimalism. 
22:22: I GOT ACCEPTED INTO [[NYU Tandon Bridge]]!!! This is really great news and buys me a good bit of time to make some money (and sell some mushrooms) before I move out and start my life. I think the game plan will be New York! I look forward to getting out there and starting my life.
