Finished up the homework this morning. Took about a day to workout all the problems and write them into LaTeX. I also caught up on some work. I need to be more scheduled and routined. I keep saying this but it's hard. Sleep is the main thing that I have a hard time controlling about myself. I think I should just try to focus on getting up to speed on sleep, and I mean controlling how much I sleep. I need to wake up at a consistent time everyday, regardless of when I went to sleep the night before. I cannot nap. Napping throws off everything, then I end up doom scrolling on my phone for hours when I should be studying or writing notes or working on problems.
