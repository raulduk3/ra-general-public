I haven't written down anything in here in the last few days, buy I feel the need to today. I lost my wallet within the last 48 hours, I am officially kissing it goodbye.

It's so annoying to me because I had to cancel my Discover, Alliant, and new payroll cards. I have to be more careful about these things. I am instituting a new rule: my wallet, phone, and vape MUST be at my desk when I am at home, otherwise they are in my pocket. If I am at home, my wallet, vape, and phone are at my desk. If I am not home, my wallet, vape, and phone are in my pocket. 

If I am home, my wallet, vape, and phone are at my desk. If I am not home, my wallet, vape, and phone are in my pocket.

I lost my Kenyon IDs, which makes me sad. I think its a reason to frame my diploma now. 

I put the diploma in the case that ODEI sent me. If I ever get filthy rich, I will donate to Kenyon.
