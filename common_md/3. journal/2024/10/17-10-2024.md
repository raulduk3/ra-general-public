Have not been writing in here lately... Definitely using this to track my running todo list, but I need to spend more time writing. Karina and life is a constant distraction and I am always being pulled in some other direction. If the phone isn't ringing, someone needs something. Or I am at work. It's going to be a very busy fall, as I expect it will be a cold winter and I will slow down a lot. I want to make sure I get some space set up somewhere in the house to ride my bike in the indoor wheel. I need to be able to do that to feel good, on top, and ready throughout the cold months. Its a good workout and you don't have to leave the house in the lip-licking cold.
